# 🍕 **Pizza Sales Analysis** – An End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Project 🚀

Welcome to the **Pizza Sales Analysis Project**! This end-to-end data engineering pipeline uses **Azure** services to process, analyze, and visualize pizza sales data. This project showcases a modern cloud-based solution to handle data migration, transformation, and visualization using **Azure Data Factory**, **Azure Databricks**, and **Power BI**.

---

## **Project Overview** ✨

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to uncover valuable insights. The solution demonstrates how to use **Azure** services for seamless data migration, cloud storage, processing, and business intelligence (BI) visualizations.

### **Key Highlights:**

- **Data Ingestion**: Imported pizza sales data from CSV into **SQL Server**.
- **Data Migration**: Utilized **Azure Data Factory** for transferring data from SQL Server to **Azure Blob Storage**.
- **Data Processing**: Leveraged **Azure Databricks** with **PySpark** and **Spark SQL** for data transformation and aggregation.
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive **Power BI dashboards** to visualize total sales, revenue trends, and more.
